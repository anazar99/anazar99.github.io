ABSTRACT = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) panels have garnered significant attention with the emergence of next-generation network technologies. This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach that leverages Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors to enhance user localization and beamforming in RIS-assisted networks. Integrating LiDAR sensors into the network will be instrumental, offering high-speed and precise 3D mapping capabilities, even in low light or adverse weather conditions. LiDAR data facilitate user localization, enabling the determination of optimal RIS coefficients. Our approach extends a Graph Neural Network (GNN) by integrating LiDAR-captured user locations as inputs. This extension enables the GNN to effectively learn the mapping from received pilots to optimal beamformers and reflection coefficients to maximize the RIS-assisted sumrate among multiple users. The permutation-equivariant and -invariant properties of the GNN proved advantageous in efficiently handling the LiDAR data. Our simulation results demonstrated significant improvements in sum rates compared with conventional methods. Specifically, including locations improved on excluding locations by up to 25% and outperformed the Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) channel estimation by up to 85% with varying downlink power and 98% with varying pilot lengths, and showed a remarkable 190% increase with varying downlink power compared with scenarios excluding the RIS.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are innovative technologies that aim to enhance the quality of communication in next-generation networks. These technologies are individually tailored to specific applications and have demonstrated impressive results. UAVs are known for their flexibility and ease of deployment, while RIS can adapt to changing environments by altering the traditional propagation and reflection schemes. Recent research has combined these two technologies for various applications, improving communication and data transmission in next-generation networks. This paper surveys recent advancements in using tethered and untethered UAVs and RIS in 5G/6G networks. The main objective of this survey is to inspire further solutions that support RIS-assisted UAVs and to provide insights not covered in published UAV--RIS surveys. The survey summarizes how UAVs and RIS can be used to address communication issues. Two case studies are presented to further illustrate this integration's potential benefits. The first case study demonstrates a UAV mounting an RIS to mitigate the impact of base station fronthaul failure. The results suggest that co-locating tethered UAVs with a selected number of base stations can proactively restore any failed fronthaul links. The second case study explores the 3D trajectory of the UAV and the phase shift design of the RIS based on the number of RIS elements and height placement of the UAV. The study considers an untethered UAV with a terrestrial RIS and shows that the propulsion energy of the UAV can be reduced by changing and adjusting the height of the UAV.},
