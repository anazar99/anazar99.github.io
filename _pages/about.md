Hello! I'm Ahmad Nazar, originally from Kuwait and currently based in the United States. I earned my Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Engineering from Iowa State University. For my Ph.D, my focus was on Wireless Networking and Communication Systems, and within that scope I focused heavily on the intersection of Applied Generative AI and multi-modal sensor fusion.

My research explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be combined with vision, LiDAR, radar, GPS, environmental data and other interesting forms of multi-modal data to create intelligent systems that perceive, reason, and act in real-world environments. I build frameworks that bring together generative models and agent-based architectures for applications such as wireless communication, autonomous decision-making, and infrastructure-to-vehicle systems.

At the heart of my work is a simple but important goal:  
> to make a positive difference in the world — no matter how small — and to inspire others to pursue what they truly love.

This site highlights my research, publications, projects, and a resource hub designed to help others get started in generative AI and multi-modal reasoning. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious, I hope you find something here that sparks your interest or helps you along your journey.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or connect.
