Generative AI represents a powerful paradigm shift in how machines can **create**, **reason**, and **adapt** across a wide range of data types and domains. In my work, I explore how to leverage deep learning architectures and large-scale models to push the boundaries of perception, decision-making, and environmental understanding ‚Äî particularly when combining multiple modalities like vision, LiDAR, radar, and text.

## üîß Core Techniques

Much of my generative AI research is built upon the following foundations:

 - Custom Deep Learning Architectures
 - Multi-Modal Data Handling
 - LLM-Orchestrated Agents


## üß† Techniques I Use in Generative AI

- Designing and training **deep learning models** (CNNs, Transformers, LSTMs, etc.) tailored for generative tasks
- Handling **multi-modal sensor data** and fusing it for structured reasoning
- Using **LLMs (Large Language Models)** for perception-aware decision-making and task orchestration
- Using **representation learning** and **agent systems** to build adaptable pipelines
- Integrating **generative pipelines** with traditional signal processing and AI applications

## üåç Interdisciplinary & Domain Applications

Generative AI is not limited to natural language or image generation. I apply these techniques to a variety of interdisciplinary areas:

- **Wireless communication**: Agent-based beam prediction, blockage detection, and channel reasoning
- **Autonomous systems**: Environmental awareness from fused multi-modal perception
- **Digital health**: LLM-driven tools that support context-aware reasoning and empathetic decision support
- **Education & accessibility**: Generating adaptive explanations, AI-driven tutoring, and content alignment

## ‚ú® Why It Matters

Generative AI opens the door to intelligent systems that don‚Äôt just react ‚Äî they interpret, imagine, and adapt. By combining deep learning, multi-modal integration, and large-scale generative models, we can build systems that operate robustly across complex, real-world environments.

This introduction serves as a launchpad for the rest of this resource hub. If you‚Äôre new to generative AI or exploring how to apply it in your field, this is the place to start.
