## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps

# Step 1: Ensure Python 3.10 or above is installed. This guides assumes Python 3.10 

# Step 2 (Windows/Linux):

# Step 2 (macOS):

# Step 3: Verify Installation 
Run the code below to check that PyTorch has successfully installed and can access the GPU


{% raw %}

```python
import torch

# if Windows/Linux
print(torch.cuda.is_available()) # prints True if PyTorch has access to the Cuda GPU

# if macOS
print(torch.backeds.mps.is_available()) # prints True if PyTorch has access to the Mac's metal GPU

```

{% endraw %}
